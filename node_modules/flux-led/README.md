# flux-led
Lightweight (no deps) Node.js library to scan network for and control Flux (aka \"Magic Home\") WiFi RGB LED strips &amp; light bulbs.

Special thanks to @steve228uk's [flux_led](https://github.com/beville/flux_led) Python project for the protocol to make this possible.

Examples coming soon.
